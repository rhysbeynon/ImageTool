## Usage  
*Before running the script, check that "$scriptlock" on line 14 is set to false.*  
This script has a built-in lock mechanic that will prevent accidental execution when transfering or  editing in an IDE. The script will tell you if it is locked after running.  
Make sure this is set to "false" 
  
*ffmpeg.exe must be placed in the root folder*  
Most FFMPEG versions after 2007 should work but we reccomend version 6.1.1 or higher as that is the version used  
when writing this script.  
Ffmpeg.exe is licensed under LGPL license and GPL General License, and is provided alongside this script.
